# Hello, Everyone!

<h2>I am Carlos Barrera a Full Stack Software Engineer, based out of Southern California Los Angeles.</h2>

Here are small samples of my code, the KommuSampleCode has most of my full stack code from front end to back end. 
While this is my sample code there is future projects I am working on right now that I will make public once I feel they are ready.
The dream I am working towards now is to become the best Software Engineer and start my own page for Vets and to raise awarness on
Vets Mental Health and Suicide Awarness.
